            <p class="mt--40">I worked in Fortnite for around 2 years, focusing on UI engineering of existing and new features. I was part of different teams but most of the work was done in Front page UI experience, selecting gamemodes, MOTD, etc</p>
            
            
            <h3 class="title mt--40">Leadership and trainings</h3>

            <p class="mt--40">I was leading a team of 5 Tech UI Designers from Globant that worked for Epic Games in different game modes. I was responsible of providing them technical guidance, code reviews and helping them to unblock any technical issues they had.</p>
            </p>
            <p class="mt--40">I also provided different workshops and trainings to the team, sharing Epic Games best practices and guidelines for UI development in Unreal Engine. The workshops covered topics such as UMG implementation, MVVM pattern and UI Shaders.

            <p class="mt--40">During the time I worked on Fortnite, I was able to contribute to the Music Library feature that was released for Fortnite Festival game mode, doing bug fixing such as navigation, asset loading and gamepad support.
            </p>
            <p class="mt--40">The music library is a feature that allows players to select the song to be played during the game, select difficulties, manage their playlist and browse the leaderboards.

            </ul>
            <p class="mt--40">I was one of the main developers on the MOTD system for Fortnite. Basically the MOTD is a Common Activatable Widget that displayed dynamic content.
              I was responsible of updating the main widget and components with UMG, BPs and C++.
            </p>
            <p class="mt--40">The dynamic content was created using a custom CMS that Epic Games created for Fortnite, the content was fetched using REST API, then parse the formatted JSON and display it on the MOTD widget. It allows differt type of content such as images, videos and customizables buttons.
            </p>
            <p class="mt--40">Each button implementation should be flexible enough to support different actions, such as opening a URL, navigating to a different part of the UI or launching a specific game mode.
