            </ul>
            <p class="mt--40">I worked on Fortnite for approximately 2 years, focusing on UI engineering for existing and new features. I was part of different teams, but most of the work was done on the front page UI experience, including gamemode selection, MOTD, and more.</p>
            
            
            <h3 class="title mt--40">Leadership and Training</h3>

            <p class="mt--40">I led a team of 5 Tech UI Designers from Globant who worked for Epic Games on different game modes. I was responsible for providing technical guidance, code reviews, and helping them resolve any technical issues they encountered.
            </p>
            <p class="mt--40">I also provided various workshops and training sessions to the team, sharing Epic Games best practices and guidelines for UI development in Unreal Engine. The workshops covered topics such as UMG implementation, MVVM pattern, and UI Shaders.
            </p>

            </ul>
            <p class="mt--40">During my time working on Fortnite, I contributed to the Music Library feature that was released for the Fortnite Festival game mode, performing bug fixes related to navigation, asset loading, and gamepad support.
            </p>
            <p class="mt--40">The Music Library is a feature that allows players to select songs to be played during the game, choose difficulties, manage their playlists, and browse leaderboards.

            </ul>
            <p class="mt--40">I was one of the main developers for the MOTD system in Fortnite. The MOTD is a Common Activatable Widget that displays dynamic content.
              I was responsible for updating the main widget and components using UMG, Blueprints, and C++.
            </p>
            <p class="mt--40">The dynamic content was created using a custom CMS that Epic Games developed for Fortnite. The content was fetched using a REST API, then parsed from formatted JSON and displayed on the MOTD widget. It supports different types of content such as images, videos, and customizable buttons.
            </p>
            <p class="mt--40">Each button implementation needed to be flexible enough to support different actions, such as opening a URL, navigating to a different part of the UI, or launching a specific game mode.
