            <p class="mt--40">I was one of the main developers on the MOTD system for Fortnite. Basically the MOTD is a Common Activatable Widget that displayed dynamic content.
              I was responsible of updating the main widget and components with UMG, BPs and C++.

            <p class="mt--40">The dynamic content was created using a custom CMS that Epic Games created for Fortnite, the content was fetched using REST API, then parse the formatted JSON and display it on the MOTD widget. It allows differt type of content such as images, videos and customizables buttons.

            <p class="mt--40">Each button implementation should be flexible enough to support different actions, such as opening a URL, navigating to a different part of the UI or launching a specific game mode.
