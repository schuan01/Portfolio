            </ul>
            <p class="mt--40">The project's UI was created a long time ago, and the technology used is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaleform_GFx">Scaleform GFx</a>
            with ActionScript 3. Part of my work was to propose a new solution using these technologies to support global styling across the entire UI.
            My proposal was divided into two solutions. The first was a global style system that loads XML during runtime and parses it using ActionScript. With this approach, we have a single source of truth
            for different core components and their properties (colors, fonts, and animations).
            The second solution was to create a plugin for Adobe Animate with <a href="https://github.com/hyperbrew/bolt-cep">bolt-cep</a> that allows designers to easily create and apply styles to components using a visual interface.</p>

              <li>P4 CLI & .NET API</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt--40">The project's UI primarily involves binary files. These files are created and edited using Adobe Animate (previously Flash CS6).
            These files are not mergeable by default, which creates a significant bottleneck when multiple designers are working on the same files.
            To solve this problem, I proposed and led the development of a tool that allows designers to easily merge files using Perforce as version control.
            The tool is a .NET application that uses the P4 API to automate the merging process.</p>
