            </ul>
            <p class="mt--40">The project's UI was created a lot of time ago and the technology used is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaleform_GFx">Scaleform GFx</a>
            with ActionScript 3. Part of my work was to propose a new solution using the mentioned technologies to support global styling across the entire UI.
            My proposal was divided in two solutions. The first one was a global style system that loads XML during runtime and parse it using ActionScript, with that approach we have one single source of truth
            for different core components and its properties (colors, fonts and animations).
            The second solution was to create a plugin for Adobe Animate with <a href="https://github.com/hyperbrew/bolt-cep">bolt-cep</a> that allows designers to easily create and apply styles to components using a visual interface.</p>

              <li>P4 CLI & .NET API</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt--40">The project's UI mainly involves binary files. These files are created and edited using Adobe Animate (previously Flash CS6).
            These files are not mergeable by default, which creates a big bottleneck when multiple designers are working on the same files.
            To solve this problem, I proposed and led the development of a tool that allows designers to easily merge the files using Perforce as version control.
            The tool is a .NET application that uses the P4 API to automate the merging process.</p>
