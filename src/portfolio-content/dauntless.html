            <p class="mt--40">I worked in Dauntless for around 1 year, focusing on UI engineering of existing and new features. I was part of a team called "Systems" that was responsible for core UI systems, features in Menus and gameplay</p>

            <ul class="list-style">
              <li>Unreal Engine 4</li>
              <li>UMG</li>
              <li>C++</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt--40">One of the main features that I owned was the Ramsgate map, which was a realtime map of the main city hub in Dauntless.
              I was responsible of creating the widget from scratch, load the data using Data Tables and implement all the interactions using UMG and C++.
            </p>
            <p class="mt--40">Also I was able to extend the Engine code to support this kind of Camera View position to 2D coordinates conversion, allowing to easily position elements on the map based on world coordinates.
