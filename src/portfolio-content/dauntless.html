            <p class="mt--40">I worked on Dauntless for approximately 1 year, focusing on UI engineering for existing and new features. I was part of a team called "Systems" that was responsible for core UI systems, menu features, and gameplay.</p>

            <ul class="list-style">
              <li>Unreal Engine 4</li>
              <li>UMG</li>
              <li>C++</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt--40">One of the main features I owned was the Ramsgate map, which was a real-time map of the main city hub in Dauntless.
              I was responsible for creating the widget from scratch, loading the data using Data Tables, and implementing all interactions using UMG and C++.
            </p>
            <p class="mt--40">I was also able to extend the Engine code to support Camera View position to 2D coordinate conversion, allowing easy positioning of elements on the map based on world coordinates.
